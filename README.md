Forked
------
Forked from [sticki](https://bitbucket.org/sticki/pyautorescene)  

pyautorescene
=============
pyautorescene automates the process of returning un-rarred scene releases back into their former glory.  It makes use of [PyReScene](https://github.com/srrDB/pyrescene) and [srrDB](http://srrdb.com) to make the whole process has hands off as possible. 
With this fork, it is possible to log in your srrdb account to bypass the daily download limit of srr. Redirect for srrxx is automatic don't worry about it...
Now it is also possible to add only nfo/sfv/Sample/Proof/Subs if you already have releases in scene format but no longer the unrarred .mkv (Can rebuild if you have something missing and you still have them in the same directory).
Now it is also possible to search unrarred files against CRC just to check if they have .srr available or good CRC for exemple.

Requirements
------------
The main requirement is that you have already installed PyReScene from source as per the [instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20190118053832/https://bitbucket.org/Gfy/pyrescene/src/).  This tool does not work with the pre-compiled .exes.

And for compressed RAR use these two WinRaR setup pack [<=4.20 + betas](http://www.mediafire.com/?ooedhgdei3cm72u) and [5.50b1 up to 7.00b4](https://www.mediafire.com/file/jvgoh37eq71d6og/RARSETUP-X64-511%252B550b1-to-700b4.rar) and use this powershell script [preprardir.ps1](https://github.com/MRiCEQB/PS_preprardir), You just need to extract these pack and in cmd with admin right put: `powershell -executionpolicy bypass -File .\preprardir.ps1`.

Installation
------------
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Via terminal/command prompt navigate to the folder
3. Edit `utils/res.py`, fill `USERNAME/PASSWORD` to login your srrdb account, 
4. Fill `RAR_VERSION` with the path that you have the WinRAR executables (you must run `preprardir.ps1` before) and fill `SRR_TEMP_FOLDER` who is just a temp folder for the recompressing process. (**Doesn't work under linux...**)
5. Run `python setup.py install`

Usage
-----
Currently, the best and most tested method of executing this script is `autorescene.py -vaf -o /path/to/output /path/to/input`

It is **seriously** recommended to output to a completely separate folder that you're happy to delete.


If you already have releases in scene format but no longer the unrarred .mkv and you want to search against srrdb if you have missing files like nfo/sfv/Sample/Proof/Subs do `autorescene.py -vc /path/to/input`

If you want to do te same with check CRC `autorescene.py -vc --check-crc /path/to/input`

If you want to search files against srrdb to know if they are corrupt or if they have a .srr available do `autorescene.py -vs /path/to/input`

```
stick$ autorescene.py --help
usage: autorescene.py [--opts] input1 [input2] ...

automated rescening of unrarred/renamed scene files

positional arguments:
  input                 file or directory of files to be parsed

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --auto-reconstruct
                        full auto rescene - this will scan directories, locate
                        files, check srrdb, and a release into a release dir
                        with original rars and nfo/sfv/etc and sample, if srs
                        exists - this is the same as -jkx
  -j, --rescene         recreate rars from extracted file/srr
  -k, --resample        recreate sample from original file/srs
  -f, --find-sample     if sample creation fails, look for sample file on disk
  -g, --resubs          look for sub rar if file is missing
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        set the directory for all output
  -v, --verbose         verbose output for debugging purposes
  --rename              rename scene releases to their original scene
                        filenames
  -x, --extract-stored  extract stored files from srr (nfo, sfv, etc)
  -e EXTENSION, --extension EXTENSION
                        list of extensions to check against srrdb (default:
                        .mkv, .avi, .mp4, .iso)
  -c, --check-extras    check missing Sample/Proof, this will scan directories, 
                        check srrdb, and add into a release dir with original rars 
                        nfo/sfv/proof and recreate sample
  --check-crc           check crc in sfv file when using --check-extras
  --keep-srr            keep srr in output directory
  --keep-srs            keep srs in output directory
  -s, --search-srrdb    check crc against srrdb and print release name
```

If you have a dynamic IP or you encounter a disconnection which causes an error like this:

```
- Connecting srrdb.com...  [FAIL]  -> ValueError() takes no keyword arguments
- Searching srrdb.com for matching Release: release.name  [FAIL]  -> name 's' is not defined
```

Then just double click on the .bat file and relaunch the script **but before you need to edit it and change the username in the path by your own!**

NEW IN V2.0
-----
* All the code rewrited, optimised, simplified and modernized
* Fixed many crashed or bug like:
  - Crashes when multiples proof or .srs inside .srr
  - Crashes without any reason except bad code
  - Didn't case sensitive for file extension or path
  - Not a good exclusion method for subdirs of a release for -vc (check extras) with or without --check-crc
  - Not a good method for subrar check or reconstruction
  - Skipping a file if a release have already been checked didn't work well
* Fixed counter for scanned release and success release
* Fixed multiple different print style when Sample, Proof, Subs rar or release rar is missing
* Fixed subtitles rebuild for:
  - Single Subs .rar: idx and sub in the same .rar file
  - Double Subs .rar: a .rar file with .idx or .sub inside a rar with .idx or .sub too
  - Multiple Subs .rar: multiple .rar with .idx and .sub inside a .rar (many of cd1/cd2 release use this one) 
* Added feature to search files against srrdb with CRC to know if .srr exist or if CRC is good
* Added feature to check if something anormal or weird is inside the release, like double nfos, sfv missing, multiple Proof or Sample dir and many other things...
* Added a counter for no matched result
* Added orange color when a RAR reconstruction is using compression method
* Maybe more but I don't remember...


To Do
-----
* Have a feddback about bugs or malfunction under linux
* Check if it is possible to rebuild compressed RAR under linux
  - How to fix this bullshit ?
